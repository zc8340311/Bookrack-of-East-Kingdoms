##Condition probability and Bayes rules

* key idea that all information are partial

* the square is uncountable, it is much bigger that a integer sequence.  $U{(x,y)} != \sum_{i} A_{i}$.
* condition probability are also probabilities they also follow the rules of prbability like mutually exclusive, union exhaustive, and additivity like $P(A U B | C) = P(A|C)+P(B|C)$
